# Image-Classification-with-Fully-Connected-Neural-Networks
An image classification system using fully connected feed-forward neural networks trained on RGB image data. Two architectures (2-layer and 3-layer) are evaluated with dropout regularization, He initialization, and gradient descent optimization for accuracy and generalization.
